\section{The disease transmission model}
We specify a model for a univariate time series, measured in discrete time units. Say that $Y_{i,t}$ are the number of observed cases of disease $i$ within a particular time window $t$. Furthermore, $X_{i,t}$ are the total number of cases occuring in time $t$. The theoretical transmission model (adapted from Finkenstadt and Grenfell) could be written as
\begin{equation}
X_{i,t} = \beta_t \cdot X_{i,t-1}^{\alpha_1} \cdot S_{i,t-1}^{\alpha_2}
\end{equation}
where $S_{i,t}$ is the number of susceptible individuals to disease $i$ at time $t$ and 
% lifted from supplemental materials of JRSI paper
the $\beta_t$ are a time-varying transmission parameters.  
The $\alpha$ are mixing parameters, which, if both equal 1, define a population with homogeneous mixing whereas values not equal to 1 have been used to describe departures from mass-action mixing 
%\cite{liu1987dynamical} 
and to account for discretization of continuous time transmission processes 
%\cite{glass2003interpreting}
.


Therefore, a statistical formulation of the theoretical transmission model would be
\begin{eqnarray}
{\mathbb E}[ X_{i,t}|X_{\cdot,t-1}, S_{i,t-1}] & = & \log\beta_t + \alpha_1 \log X_{t-1} + \alpha_2 \log S_{i,t-1}
\end{eqnarray}
where the $\alpha_t$ coefficients (there are $S$ of them) represent the seasonal baselines, and $p_t$ are time-varying case-reporting probabilities. We intentionally leave the distributional assumption for $X_{i,t}$ unspecified for now, although it would likely be specified as Poisson or Negative Binomial.

The heart of this model resides in our definition of the $S_{i,t}$. In the past, we have defined this measure of susceptibility along these lines:
\begin{eqnarray}
S_{i,t} & = & S_{i,t-1} + B_{t-d} - I_{i,t} -\delta\sum_{j\neq i}[I_{j,t-1}- I_{j,t-(k+1)}]. 
\end{eqnarray}
\section{The model for an observation process}
And the observation process could be modeled as 
\begin{eqnarray}
Y_{i,t} | X_{i,t} & \sim & Binomial(p_{i,t}, X_{i,t})
%\bm{Y_t} | \bm{X_t} & \sim & Multinomial(\bm{p_t}, N_t)
\end{eqnarray}
where the $p_{i,t}$ are calculated based on, say, a standard susceptible reconstruction. It would probably even be more accurate to say that $p_{i,t}\sim Beta(a,b)$ such that the mean of the beta distribution is equal to that of the estimated $p$ from the susceptible reconstruction, and the variance is equal to that of resulting from the fit.
%some known disease-specific reporting fractions that are varying over time and $N_t$ is the total number of cases of any disease under consideration observed at time $t$. For example, we observe four under-reported serotype-specific case counts over time (the $Y_{i,t}$, or more succinctly, the $\bm{Y_t}$ and one total case count ($N_t$). Then, the $\bm{p_t}$ could be estimated by $p_{i,t} = \frac{Y_{i,t}}{N_t}$.
